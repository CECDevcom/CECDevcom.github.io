        <p> There was a time when Web had the lowest barrier for entry into softwere. Everything was super easy back then. Almost
          anybody could easily set up their site and share thier thoughts with the world. There were no complicated CMS frameworks,
          no javascript jargon, no backend black magic and no anything more than just some text marked up.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We have come a long way from static boring HTML and CSS. We now have the overexpolited power of Javascript at our
          fingertips. Evertything goes out of the way when we see an awesome new data visiualisation with rotating SVG's.
          Everthing feels slick, but at what cost.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That's all, I have hit a writers block. See you soon.</p>
